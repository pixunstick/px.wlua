# About

This is a program designed to flash a color on and off rapidly. You can use this to attempt to unstick a pixel by flashing the stuck pixel for several hours (results not guaranteed).

The flashing window (it's 5x5 pixels) can be dragged with the mouse.

# History

This program was mostly influenced by [UDPixel](http://udpix.free.fr/), created to address some of its shortcomings (specifically the missing tray icon when minimized).

# Running

To run px.wlua, you'll need:

- [Lua](http://lua.org)
- [IUPLua](http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/)

On Windows, you can get all this and more by installing [Lua for Windows](http://code.google.com/p/luaforwindows/downloads/detail?name=LuaForWindows_v5.1.4-40.exe).

Outside of Windows, check your local package manager (which will most likely have packages for Lua) and/or Sourceforge (there are some good tips out there for setting up the IUP library files you can get from Sourceforge if you search for them).
